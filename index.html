Rust notes:

To Rust debug cargo tests in GDB:

1) Run:  "cargo test" and observe filename, for example: "target/debug/deps/starbreeze-a286203a95999cae"
2) Run: "rust-gdb <filename>"
3) I've found "info functions" to be handy way to see all symbols
4) Once you know the filename and line number, set a breakpoint: break src/filename.rs:linenumber
5) Type: "run" to start your program
6) Type: "layout src" to get a visual layout of the file and the break point
